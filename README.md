# React + Vite Testing with RTL and Jest

This project is a React application set up with Vite, created to try out RTL and Jest testing for exercises and examples. 

For the setup of RTL and Jest with Vite, I followed [this guide](https://dev.to/teyim/effortless-testing-setup-for-react-with-vite-typescript-jest-and-react-testing-library-1c48).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JtMeulen/react-testing.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Testing

This project uses RTL (React Testing Library) and Jest for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
# or for a single file
npm run test my-file.test.txs
```

For TDD (Test-Driven Development), use the following command:

```
npm run test:watch
```

To check the test coverage, use the following command:

```
npm run test:coverage
```
